Chip's Challenge: Differences between the Lynx and Windows versions

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Chip's Challenge 2 has finally been released. This is great news for
lots of reasons, but among other things this means that we have yet
<i>another</i> version of Chip's Challenge 1 to analyze!
<p>
For the most part, the new Chip's Challenge 1 appears to adhere quite
closely to the original Lynx game. (In fact it adheres even more
closely to the MS-DOS port, and possibly to some or all of the other
pre-Windows ports. These earlier ports were done by Epyx, and probably
involved some of the same people who had developed the original game.
The Windows port was done internally by Microsoft, and it's not always
obvious that the people who worked on it were terribly familiar with
the original.) However, there are nonetheless some differences. I hope
to document those differences here.
<p>
(An aside: For the time being I'm calling the new version the Windows
version. This has the potential to be confused with the version for
16-bit Windows, which until recently was what anybody would have been
referring to by "the Windows version". However, I myself have always
called that "the MS version", reflecting the fact that that version
was actually written by Microsoft. The other obvious name for it would
be the "the CC2 version", which strikes me as having quite a bit more
potential for confusion.)
<p>
<h2>
Game Logic
</h2>
<p>
One of the first things that most people notice is that the animations
for splashes and explosions are only 2 ticks (4 frames) long, as
opposed to the 6 ticks of the original Lynx game. This actually
matches the MS-DOS version of the game. Certainly this change makes
the heavy block-pushing levels slightly less aggravating.
<p>
On the original Lynx, a creature on ice hitting an obstacle would
would spend that frame turning around, and would only start moving in
the opposite direction on the next frame. On the Windows version, this
no longer happens, and creatures rebounding on ice are constantly in
motion. (This has the side effect of making BLOCK BUSTER significantly
harder than it was before &mdash; maybe even harder than the Windows
version.)
<p>
On the original Lynx, when a creature caught in a bear trap was
released, the creature would start moving immediately in its current
direction. If that direction was blocked, then the creature would not
be able to leave the bear trap. (Tanks are the exception to this rule,
as they can still turn around when a blue button is pressed.) Under
the Windows version of the game, an open bear trap acts much like a
normal floor, and the creature is free to turn about normally.
<p>
<h2>
Metadata
</h2>
<p>
There is really only one major difference to the metadata, and that is
that passwords are completely gone. Level 34 (CYPHER) has completely
lost it reason for existing, and is no doubt confusing the heck out of
new CC players.
<p>
Actually, there are a few other major differences in the level
metadata, but it's only visible to people making new levels. The
important one is that it's no longer possible to specify the initial
ordering of creatures. The original Lynx game allowed for creatures to
be listed in arbitrary order, even though all of the levels in CC1
stuck to the standard ordering. (Namely, list the creatures as they
appear on the map in reading order, and then if the creature at the
head of the list is not Chip, have it swap places with Chip.) The
Windows game has no way to give an alternative ordering to the
creatures.
<p>
<h2>
The Original Level Set
</h2>
<p>
There are a small but significant number of differences in the actual
data for the original set of levels.
<p>
A few of the hints have had cosmetic alterations. For example, the
hint to level 16 (CELLBLOCKED) has been changed from "PRESS OPTION 1
TO RESTART ANY LEVEL" to "PRESS ESC TO RESTART ANY LEVEL." The hint to
level 3 (LESSON 3) has had its references to the magnet, fire shield,
and water shield replaced with magno shoes, fire boots, and flippers.
The hint to 131 (TOTALLY UNFAIR) has been rewritten from "REMEMBER
SJUM" to "REMEMBER TOTALLY FAIR", since passwords are no longer a
feature of the game. A number of the original hints were missing the
final period, and these has been fixed. And my favorite: the word
"eighth" in the hint for level 113 (OPEN QUESTION) is <i>finally</i>
spelled correctly. That fix has been a long time coming.
<p>
In level 61 (RINK), Chip is now initially facing south, instead of
initially facing north. No other level has Chip's initial direction
modified. Shrug.
<p>
Okay, on to the interesting changes.
<p>
Of course, the biggest change to the original set is that the MS level
145 has been adopted, lock stock and barrel. Even the hint, with its
reference to WEP4, has been preserved. (Of course, TONY Krueger got
ripped off here, since the passwords are gone.) I'm actually a little
annoyed by this level's presence. Setting aside the fact that it isn't
a particularly interesting level to play, I've never liked the fact
that this level calls out a bunch of MS people for thanking, while
completely ignoring Chuck Sommerville, Bill Darrah, and all the other
people who actually created the CC1 levels. (Especially when you
consider the hash that MS made of the game mechanics). So why was it
added? I'm guessing it was mainly done to avoid having a break in the
level numbering.
<p>
In level 48 (MUGGER SQUARE), the northeastern glider has been advanced
one position, presumably done specifically to avoid the collision that
strands one of the gliders on the force floors.
<p>
In level 70 (NIGHTMARE), there is a small area along the right edge of
the map containing ball in a trap. When the ball is released it
triggers a fireball clone machine. In the new level set, a water tile
has been added to that area. Under the original Lynx ruleset, after
the ball returned to the beartrap it could never escape again. That is
not the case in the Windows version, due to the new beartrap behavior.
So presumably the water tile was added to destroy the ball after it
has pressed the red button once.
<p>
In level 102 (ICEHOUSE), the ball that triggers the fireball clone
machine (at the spot where Chip lands after his initial ice slide) has
been moved north one spot. Presumably this was done to permit you to
survive the initial slide even if you start the level by moving right?
<p>
In level 120 (ALPHABET SOUP), in the lowercase-d room, you may recall
that one of the three blocks has a bomb underneath it. In CC1, this
has been changed to a block covering a ... water tile. I have no idea
why this change was made. It seems a strange combination of tiles to
permit. My best guess is that, since it is possible to get the
flippers before you need the yellow key in that room, this gives you
another way to solve this level. (But getting the yellow key without
touching the block is hardly that difficult a puzzle, so I dunno.)
Also, I just want to point out that in the process they changed the
block to face south instead of north. I know it hardly matters, as
initial block direction is only significant when blocks are on clone
machines. But the fact remains that this is the only non-north-facing
block outside of a clone machine in the entire level set. It freaks me
out.
