end

% Action: whatever.
% Lynx result: Block alternates between teleports. If Chip walks to a
% teleport, block will get pushed every time. If Chip walks north of a
% teleport, Chip and block collide. With delicacy, it is possible to
% diagonally push the block off a teleport.
% TW result: Chip can teleport through block 50% of the time. Walking
% north of teleports is safe.
