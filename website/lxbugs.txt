% Action: Move west.
% Lynx result: Chip is stuck on alternate teleports. Dies when glider
% intersects top toggle floor while Chip is on top teleport. Death
% explosion remains on top teleport.
% TW result: Chip is stuck on a single teleport. Chip can control
% which one by whether or not he pushes against the toggle wall, just
% before it opens. Chip dies when glider intersects toggle floor
% opposite Chip; death explosion alternates teleports.

% can control which one. The block opposite Chip is pushed.

end

% Action: whatever.
% Lynx result: Block alternates between teleports. If Chip walks to a
% teleport, block will get pushed every time. If Chip walks north of a
% teleport, Chip and block collide. With delicacy, it is possible to
% diagonally push the block off the teleport.
% TW result: Block slides off of teleport immediately (similar to the
% behavior of a block starting on an open beartrap).

% Action: Push block onto force floor, then attempt to push it into
% the water.
% Lynx result: Chip can push the block against the force floor and
% into the water by first picking up the magnet.
% TW result: The block cannot be pushed against the force floor, with
% or without the force boots.

% Action: Move and hold south.
% Lynx result: Chip is able to hold the cloned block back as long as
% he keeps pushing down. (If he stops pushing without moving away, the
% block kills him.)
% TW result: Chip is immediately killed by the block.

% Action: walk north.
% Lynx result: Because Chip is standing on the east teleport, the
% glider is unable to teleport, and so passes through to collide with
% Chip. (The Lynx then freezes up, and has to be restarted, but TW
% doesn't need to emulate that part.)
% TW result: Chip and the glider teleport past each other.
