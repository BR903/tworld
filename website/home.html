<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge". "Chip's
Challenge" was originally written for the Atari Lynx by Chuck
Sommerville, and was later ported to MS Windows by Microsoft (among
other ports).
<p>
<b>Please note:</b> Tile World is an emulation of the game engine(s)
only. It does <em>not</em> come with the <tt>chips.dat</tt> file that
contains the original level set. This file is copyrighted and cannot
be freely distributed. The <tt>chips.dat</tt> file was originally part
of the MS version of "Chip's Challenge". If you have a copy of this
version of the game, you can use that file to play the game in Tile
World. If you do not have a copy of this file, however, you can still
play Tile World with the many freely available level sets created by
fans of the original game, including the three Chip's Challenge Level
Packs.
<p>
"Chip's Challenge" is a game made up of both intellectually engaging
puzzles and situations demanding fast reflexes. As you might have
guessed, it is a tile-based game. The object of each level is simply
to get out &mdash; i.e., to find and achieve the exit tile. This simple
task, however, can sometimes be extremely challenging.

<p>
Because the version that Microsoft released introduced a number of
changes to the rules of the game, Tile World is capable of emulating
either the MS version or the original Atari Lynx version of the game.
<p>
Tile World uses the SDL library. The Windows distribution includes a
copy of the SDL library (version 1.2.15). Linux users will need to
install SDL, if they do not already have it installed, before
compiling the program. SDL can be obtained here:
