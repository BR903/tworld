<h1>The CC2M File Format</h1>
</center>
</p>

<p>This document describes the basic format of the CC2M file format. The
name "CC2M" is short for "Chip's Challenge 2 Map", and this is the
native format used for CC2 levels. However, it is also used for the
CC1 levels that accompany the CC2 release, and this is what is
documented below. Please note that this document <em>only</em> covers those
aspects of the file format as used by the CC1 ruleset; CC2-specific
features are documented elsewhere.</p>

<p>Please also note that this is a work in progress. There are still
several aspects of the CC2M file format that are unexplained below.</p>

<h3>The Basic Layout</h3>

<p>The file header is ten bytes in size, and consists of the following
three fields:</p>

<table>
<tr><td align="center">0-3</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>signature bytes: <code>"CC2M"</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4-7</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>signature value: 2</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">8-9</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>file subtype: a value between 0x33 and 0x37</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is not fully known what the file subtype indicates. The assumption
is that it is a version number that allows the software to be
backwards-compatible with previous file versions. Note that the
observed values map to the ASCII digits <code>"3"</code> through <code>"7"</code>. It is
assumed that this is not coincidental, and the rest of this text will
refer to subtypes 3 through 7.</p>

<p>The file header is followed by a list of one or more blocks. These
blocks comprise the file's contents.</p>

<p>Each block begins with an eight-byte header:</p>

<table>
<tr><td align="center">0-3</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>block type, e.g. <code>"LOCK"</code>, <code>"TITL"</code></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">4-7</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of block contents (not including this header)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The block type signature is always four ASCII characters. Type names
which are only three characters long are space-padded, such as with
<code>"KEY "</code> and <code>"END "</code>.</p>

<p>The header is followed by the block contents, the details of which
depend on the block type.</p>

<p>Many blocks consist of a single string. Strings are always terminated
with a NUL byte. An empty string block is encoded as a single NUL
byte.</p>

<h3>The Block Types</h3>

<p>The following list covers the details of each block type.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>TITL</code> block <em>(required)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A string containing the level's name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>LOCK</code> block <em>(optional)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A string describing the level's provenance, or something similar. In
the CC1 levels this block either names Chuck Sommerville, John K.
Elion, or Alice Voith.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>CLUE</code> block <em>(optional)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A string containing the hint text. Line breaks are marked with a CR LF
pair (though the CC1 game will wrap text with long lines). Levels with
no hints typically have a single line break as the complete text
instead of an empty string (or just being omitted, which is what they
original Lynx levels did).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>AUTH</code> block <em>(required?)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A string typically providing the name of the level's author.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>NOTE</code> block <em>(optional)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An optional string value, presumably with no explicit requirements as
to its contents. Typical usage in CC1 is to name the person who
recorded the accompanying solution. (Given the frequency of typos in
the existing NOTE blocks, this data is not meant to be displayed to
the player.) In CC2 it often contains extra hint texts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>VERS</code> block <em>(optional)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A string value, presumably indicating a version number for the map.
This block is not used with any CC1 levels, and only appears in a
handful of CC2 levels.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>OPTN</code> block <em>(required?)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short string of bytes indicating various global settings. The first
two bytes gives the level's time (with zero indicating no time limit).
The third byte is always one in CC1. Levels of subtype 3, 4, and 5
always have only three bytes in this block. Levels of subtype 6 and 7
have up to 25 bytes. The next three bytes, if present, are all low
integers, with zero being the most common (only two CC1 have a single
one value). The remaining bytes, if present, show no obvious pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>PACK</code> block <em>(required)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This block defines the level's map and the placement of its initial
contents. As the name suggests, the data in this block has been
"packed", or compressed. Descriptions of both the data in this
block and the unpacking algorithm are given below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>KEY</code> block <em>(optional)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This block is always 16 bytes long. No obvious pattern is present in
the values. Its purpose is unknown. Perhaps it is a checksum of some
kind? Only one level in the CC1 set lacks a <code>KEY</code> block; presumably this
is due to an oversight rather than that level being actually unique in
some way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>REPL</code> / <code>PRPL</code> block <em>(optional?)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This block (whichever one is present) contains a solution replay.
Files of subtype 3 and 4 use <code>REPL</code> blocks; file of the later subtypes
use <code>PRPL</code> blocks. The replay data in each is the same, but the data
in the <code>PRPL</code> blocks has been packed. See below for descriptions of
the replay data and of the unpacking algorithm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>END</code> block <em>(required)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No content; the <code>END</code> block always marks the end of the block list.</p>

<h3>How to Decompress Packed Block Data</h3>

<p>Both the <code>PACK</code> blocks and the <code>PRPL</code> blocks are "packed", or
compressed, using a simple scheme. The decompression algorithm works
as follows.</p>

<p>The first two bytes of the packed data block give the full size of the
data after unpacking.</p>

<p>The next byte specifies the number of unpacked bytes at the beginning
of the data. This value cannot be greater than 127. (This value also
cannot be zero, since packed bytes must be able to refer to bytes that
appear earlier in the data stream.)</p>

<p>Unpacked bytes are copied to the output stream without modification.</p>

<p>After a sequence of unpacked bytes comes a sequence of repeated bytes
&mdash; typically three or more bytes that matches a sequence
appearing earlier in the stream. This repeated sequence is encoded by
a pair of bytes in the packed data stream.</p>

<p>The first byte of the pair always has the high bit (0x80) set. The
other seven bits specify the length of the repeated sequence. The
second byte in the pair specifies how many bytes back from the current
position that the sequence begins.</p>

<p>(Note that the two instances of the repeated sequence can actually
overlap, in which case the bytes before the overlap are repeated
throughout the overlapping region &mdash; much like using overlap in
C's memcpy() function to lay down a repeating sequence. For example,
the stream 0x41&nbsp;0x42&nbsp;0x88&nbsp;0x02 will repeat the pair
0x41&nbsp;0x42 for 10 bytes.)</p>

<p>If the byte immediately after the pair defining the repeated sequence
has its high bit set, then it is assumed to be the start of another
pair defining another repeated sequence. Otherwise, the third byte
instead provides the number of unpacked bytes that follow the triplet.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the first byte of a repeated sequence
specification does NOT have the high bit set, then it represents a
null sequence, expanding to an empty byte string. There is no second
or third byte in the specification in this case, and the one byte that
is present provides the number of unpacked bytes that follow. This
null-specification is used for when there is more than 127 consecutive
unpacked bytes in the data stream.</p>

<p>This alternation between unpacked data and strings of repeated
sequences continues until the end of the block is reached. The block
will always end with an extra NUL byte, which the last encoded
repeated sequence points to. (Note that this final NUL byte simply
marks the end of the compressed data, and is not copied to the output
stream.)</p>

<h3>Description of the Map Data</h3>

<p>The <code>PACK</code> block contains the data that (after being unpacked) defines
the level's map, including all of its contents and their initial
placement.</p>

<p>The map data begins with the first two bytes giving the width and
height of the map respectively. The bytes following this pair define
the contents of each cell of the map in reading order (left-to-right,
top-to-bottom).</p>

<p>Most map cells contain a single object or feature, which is specified
by a single byte. Some cell contents require a second byte to fully
specify them, however. Also, some contents implicitly allow other
objects to share the same cell, which appear in the data stream
immediately following. The reader of the map data needs to know which
values have these features in order to know when to advance to the
next cell.</p>

<p>In the following table, the first column gives the byte value,
followed by the name of the object that value represents. If the third
column contains a <code>+</code>, then that object takes a second byte that
further defines it (see below for details). The fourth column contains
a <code>*</code> for objects that can coexist with another object, and so will
always be followed by at least one more byte. In the case when there
is nothing else in the cell, then the following byte will be 0x01 for
empty.</p>

</table>

<p>Most contents with an extra byte are creatures, and the second byte
indicates the creature's orientation, i.e. which way the creature is
initially facing. The orientation byte will be 0x00 for north, 0x01
for east, 0x02 for south, or 0x03 for west.</p>

<p>A different type of byte is used with 0x6D, a generic partition wall
value. For this, the following byte indicates which edges have walls.
The byte will have one or more bits set, where 0x01 indicates north,
0x02 east, 0x04 south, and 0x08 west. Note that this value is partly
redundant with the content values 0x1B, 0x1C, and 0x1D. It is not
known why this is. (It is also not know if the CC1 game will actually
permit a partition wall to the north or west.)</p>

<p>All creatures permit a second set of contents to occupy the same map
cell. (This is consistent with the original Lynx game, which actually
stored creatures separately from the basic map data.)</p>

<p>The remaining contents that permit other contents are all objects that
can be removed from the cell, i.e. keys, boots, chips, and bombs. (Not
fake walls or doors, though.) In the original Lynx game these
objects could only share a cell with a creature (usually a block).
It's not clear if CC1 would actually handle such combinations as a key
atop ice, or a bomb sharing a spot with a toggle wall, but the file
format seems to permit such.</p>

<p>The file format also seems to permit an unlimited stacking of contents
in a single cell, but presumably this is just for the sake of
consistency. In practice the third set of contents in a map cell is
always 0x01 for empty.</p>

<p>Note that no metadata is present in this block (other than the map
size). This seems to indicate that not only are red and brown buttons
implicitly connected via Lynx's reading-order rule, but that it is
also impossible to change the ordering of the creature list to differ
from the order implied by the map. (This is different from the
original Lynx game, which could set an arbitrary monster order, though
this possibility was not exercised in the original levels.)</p>

<h3>Description of the Replay Data</h3>

<p>This data contains a recording of a solution for the level. The data
begins with a four-byte value. Its purpose is unknown. By far the most
common value is all-bits zero. For levels with a nonzero value in this
field, often only one of the four bytes is nonzero, so this "field"
may actually be four separate byte values.</p>

<p>The remainder of the block is a stream of two-byte entries. The first
byte value of an entry identifies the command being input. Possible
base values are:</p>

<table>
<tr><td align="center">00</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>none</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">02</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>down</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">04</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>left</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">08</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>right</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">10</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>up</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">80</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>special</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A horizontal and vertical value pair can also be bitwise-combined to
indicate a "diagonal" move. The zero value "none" is used to record
periods when no commands are selected.</p>

<p>The second byte value indicates how long the command is selected.
(That is, how long the key is held down.) The time unit for this value
appears to be 1/3 of a frame (or 1/6 of a tick), which would be equal
to 1/60 of a second.</p>

<p>The maximum possible value for the time field appears to be 0xFC
(equal to 42 ticks). If a key is held down for longer than this, then
the entry will have a time value of 0xFC, the next entry in the stream
will be the special value 0x80_0x00, and then this will be followed by a
second entry with the same command value. Its time will be added to
the 0xFC of the initial entry to give the full amount. Presumably,
multiple fields could be chained together in this fashion to record a
suitable long period of time.</p>

<p>(For many solutions, the stream is a sequence alternating between one
key down and no keys down. For many other solutions, the stream
alternates between entries for one key down and for two keys down,
depending on the user's keying habits.)</p>

<p>The end of the stream is marked with at least one entry that contains
the values 0x00&nbsp;0xFF. Sometimes there is more than one such
entry. There is often also a trailing 0x00 byte, but not always. Not
sure why.</p>
