% Action: Start the level without moving. On the next tick, push left.
% MS result: Chip replaces the fireball briefly, then is erased again
% as the fireball moves into (1,0). The fireball is somehow destroyed
% by the fire tile. If the fire is replaced by an empty tile, the
% fireball survives. Similar results can be obtained using a glider
% and water.
% TW result: The fireball moves into (1,0). Neither it nor Chip is
% harmed.

% Action: Move west.
% MS result: Chip and the cloned block get confused, and Chip gets
% pushed into the exit, presumably as the cloned block. The force
% floor and the block are replaced by an extra (south-facing) Chip.
% TW result: Chip is hit with a cloned block and dies.

% Action: Move west.
% MS result: Sometimes the same as "You Win I", and sometimes Chip is
% hit with a cloned block and dies. The only difference between this
% level and the previous one is that here the ball is alive. The
% different behaviors presumably depend on the size of the first
% second. (A full second results in death.)
% TW result: The same as "You Win I".

% Action: Move east, and then use the mouse to move south just before
% Chip is directly above the exit. (In theory, you can make the final
% move without using the mouse, but the timing is more difficult.)
% MS result: When timed correctly, Chip makes it into the exit.
% TW result: Chip always gets hit by the glider.

% Action: Use the mouse to click on the bottom force floor square.
% MS result: Chip pushes the block north when it rebounds back.

% Note: I'm assuming that this move is impossible without using the

end

% Action: Walk east.
% MS result: The block pushes the red button, cloning a block into the
% same teleport as Chip. As a result Chip and the block become
% confused. Chip is set facing north, but is not moved off of the
% now-vanished teleport. The block moves south as expected, but turns
% into a copy of the north-facing Chip. The real Chip remains on the
% slip list, despite having nothing to push against, and will make
% oofing sounds until he is moved away. The block that looks like Chip
% will slide across the force floor and land in the beartrap. When
% Chip presses the brown button, it will pop out of the trap just like
% a normal block. (If the block were to land in water instead of a
% beartrap, it would turn the water into dirt.) Chip cannot push the
% "block" at all, however, and once it is no longer slipping, it will
% become fixed at that location. If any creature hits it, Chip will die.
% TW result: Chip does not remain on the slip list after emerging from
% the teleport.
% Note 1: The bug is currently presumed to be purely cosmetic, as
% Chip's slip status does not influence slide delay.
% Note 2: The above behavior only happens when Chip has never been on
% the slip list before he teleports. In the case where Chip has a
% prior slipping direction, the block exits normally, and Chip exits
% in his prior slipping direction. TW correctly emulates this case.

% Action: Move north and hold down the key.
