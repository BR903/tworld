% Action: None.
% TW result: Both traps are permanently closed.
% MS result: Left-hand glider becomes trapped, right-hand glider does
% not. The left-hand glider moves from where the button used to be
% directly into the trap, whereas the right-hand glider does not. Chip
% can test this by moving through the right-hand trap. Only if he
% enters it from the north will he get stuck.

% Action: Variously press and release the brown buttons.
% TW result: After the brown button under the red key goes away, the
% left-hand trap behaves as if it had never been there.
% MS result: The left-hand glider can pass through the trap without
% Chip standing on the brown button, but only when moving south. When
% moving north (i.e. out of the square where the button used to be),
% the glider will be trapped.

% Action: Variously press and release the brown button.
% TW result: The trap behaves as if the extra button (under the key)
% was never there.
% MS result: The vertical ball always passed through the trap without
% becoming trapped. The horizontal ball will become trapped when
% moving eastwards into the trap unless Chip is standing on the brown
% button.

% Action: Move west.

% block arrives. The cloned block and the force floor are replaced by
% an extra (south-facing) Chip tile.

% Action: Move west.
% TW result: Chip is hit with a cloned block and dies.
% MS result: Sometimes the same as "You Win I", and sometimes Chip is
% hit with a cloned block and dies. The only difference between this
% level and the previous one is that here the ball is alive.

% Chip is directly above the exit. 
% TW result: N/A -- no mouse interface.
% MS result: When timed correctly, Chip makes it into the exit.
