I essentially made the sound effects for Tile World in my basement in
one weekend (all except one or two sounds, which were rerecorded later
on). I originally expected that these would be purely temporary. I was
just in the process of adding real sound effects to Tile World, and so
I needed a set of wav files that I could legally distribute. Not
having an appropriate set of public-domain sounds handy, I set out to
cobble together a set to be used for the time being. I fully expected
that, like the tile images I drew, someone would eventually volunteer
and produce something better to replace them. But, to my surprise, my
sound effect actually turned out pretty well, and nobody seemed to
think that they really needed replacing. And so they remain in the
current version.
<p>
As far as equipment goes, all I had was a microphone, my Linux
machine, and two programs: sox and snd. I used snd for splicing and
chopping parts, and sox provided some simple effects processing. The
only other "equipment" was whatever possessions I had that could make
noise.
<p>
The very first sound I created was
<a href="wav/force.wav">force.wav</a>, the sound of the Lynx force
floors. For this I used an actual musical instrument &mdash; a pair of
orchestral woodblocks. These things are loud enough to fill a concert
hall. I recorded a lightly tapped high-low-high-low sequence, and then
spliced out the pauses to make it fast and rhythmically perfect.
<p>
Once I had that, I sat down and recorded a variety of "mouth sounds",
which I then played around with via sox to see what I could come up
with. I discovered that using a simple band-pass filter was often
enough to transform the sound into something that no longer sounded
organic in origin. <a href="wav/click.wav">click.wav</a>, the button
sound, was a simple tongue-click altered in this fashion. The sound
for picking up an IC chip is named
<a href="wav/chack.wav">chack.wav</a> because it started out as me
saying "chk!". A short, quiet exhalation into the microphone became
<a href="wav/whisk.wav">whisk.wav</a>, which is heard when a fake blue
wall is cleared away under Lynx.
<p>
I also discovered that the same raw material could be used to provide
more than one sound effect. For example, the sound played when picking
up an object is <a href="wav/ting.wav">ting.wav</a> &mdash; a short,
high, silvery chime. This sound is just
<a href="wav/ding.wav">ding.wav</a>, the sound played when Chip runs
out of time on an MS level, played at double speed. The sound comes
from an oven timer.
<p>
A quick tap on the microphone became
<a href="wav/bump.wav">bump.wav</a>, played when the Lynx Chip can't
make an attempted move. (The analogous sound under MS is
<a href="wav/oof.wav">oof.wav</a>, which is just me saying "mmf!",
unaltered.) This same microphone tap played backwards produced
<a href="wav/bump.wav">traphit.wav</a>, played when a creature enters
a Lynx beartrap. Augmented with some reverb, the sound then became
<a href="wav/popup.wav">popup.wav</a>, played when Chip walks over a
Lynx popup wall.
<p>
<a href="wav/door.wav">door.wav</a> is the sound played when a door is
unlocked. This was originally a repeated tongue-clucking, which became
nicely dry, like metal against wood, after going through a bandpass
filter. It may surprise you to know that the same sound was used to
make <a href="wav/thief.wav">thief.wav</a>. A reverb filter, when the
reverb speed is set fast enough, will transform almost any sound into
something artificial and electronic-sounding. After putting the
original tongue-cluck through the reverb, I spliced together three
repetitions, forward-backward-forward, to make the final sound.
<p>
If the reverb speed is set too fast, the result will be short,
high-pitched, loud, and staticky. This is where I got
<a href="wav/derezz.wav">derezz.wav</a>, the sound played when Chip
dies by colliding with another creature in Lynx. I fed ting.wav
through the filter to get this sound, but the results were remarkably
similar no matter what I started with.
<p>
An echo filter can also feed back destructively, but it generally
takes longer. Playing ting.wav backwards through such an echo filter
gave me <a href="wav/teleport.wav">teleport.wav</a>, the teleporting
sound, which I cut off just before the sound began to distort.
<p>
A couple of sound effects are noteworthy for having undergone no
processing at all. <a href="wav/tick.wav">tick.wav</a>, played during
the 15 seconds before time runs out under MS, came from a small
metronome. <a href="wav/socket.wav">socket.wav</a>, played when Chip
opens the chip socket under MS, was made by giving a Chinese abacus a
sharp, twisting shake.
<p>
Two short musical sounds, <a href="wav/death.wav">death.wav</a> and
<a href="wav/tada.wav">tada.wav</a>, were also created without
processing. Both were made using a melodica, a.k.a a hooter (a simple
musical instrument that can basically be thought of as a harmonica
with a keyboard).
<p>
There are a number of continuous sound effects in the Lynx rules.
These required a slightly different approach, so as to make sound
effects that can be played in a loop.
<a href="wav/block.wav">block.wav</a> was made by rubbing together two
cinder blocks. <a href="wav/crackle.wav">crackle.wav</a> was made by
surrounding the microphone with plastic-wrap and gently crumpling it.
<p>
<a href="wav/skate.wav">skate.wav</a>, heard when Chip is sliding on
ice, started out by my saying "shhhhh" into the microphone. I then ran
it through echo and reverb filters until the sound had become
completely homogenous, and then finally treated it to a high-pass
filter. <a href="wav/skaturn.wav">skaturn.wav</a>, played when Chip is
passing through an ice corner-wall, was made by running the original
skate.wav through a phaser.
<p>
<a href="wav/slurp.wav">slurp.wav</a>, the sound played when Chip is
walking past a force floor using boots, is a simple sound made with
the tongue. Likewise, <a href="wav/snick.wav">snick.wav</a>, meant to
sound like cleats on ice, was made with my teeth.
<a href="wav/plip.wav">plip.wav</a>, heard when Chip is walking across
water, was made by quickly tapping my index finger on the surface of
water sitting in a pan. All of these sounds were also made without any
processing.
<p>
<a href="wav/bomb.wav">bomb.wav</a>, the sound of an exploding bomb,
was surprisingly difficult to make. My first attempts were made by
subjecting white noise to various filters, but they all sounded wrong.
I finally had to make the sound myself. I made an explosion noise, the
way kids do when playing at war, and then ran it through a severe
low-pass filter until it no longer sounded like a human noise.
<p>
The sound that gave me the most trouble was
<a href="wav/splash.wav">splash.wav</a>, the sound played when a block
is pushed into water. I tried recording the sound of an object falling
into water, but the result was really a slapping noise. The original
MS sound effect is more like water sloshing around, and this was the
sort of effect I wanted. After thinking about it all weekend, I
finally came up with a way to do it. I took a large glass vase, filled
with water, and placed a large pot upside-down on top of it. I then
turned the whole thing over, giving me an upside-down water-filled
vase inside a pot. I was then able to just lift up the vase, and the
water rushing out and filling the pan made the perfect sound effect.
