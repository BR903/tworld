Something's wrong somewhere in Eric Schmidt's level 29 (PARAMECIA).
Unfortunately, I don't know where the discrepancy is.
<li>
(It is debatable whether or not this one qualifies as a bug.) The
keyboard is scanned twice per tick, once at the beginning and once in
the middle. As a result, if Chip makes a move at the beginning of a
tick, the game does not update the display twice in a row (once after
the creatures move and once after Chip moves), but just does it once.
In a few places this does have a non-trivial effect on how the game
appears, most notably when Chip tries to move against a force floor.

The pattern of "clone boosting" is not the same as the Lynx game.
It's hard to find examples that clearly show this; I have only one.
Play ICE HOUSE (102) on the Lynx. After landing safely on the red
button, step right to block off the teeth clones. Stay there. When the
clock reads 130 seconds or so, there will be a fireball clone that is
boosted. It will cross the ice just before a glider comes through, and
the glider will continue on its way past the red button. However, in
the emuluator, the fireball clone is not boosted. As a result, it is
still squarely on the ice when the glider arrives, and the latter
bounces off and retreats. The boosting pattern is governed by how
slots in the creature list come back up for reuse after a creature has
been killed. Clearly, the emulator is not using the same algorithm as
the Lynx game. Unfortunately, it's a tedious business to collect any
amount of data on this that would be necessary to start finding
patterns, and there are few levels that have the necessary elements
for such investigation. So this one is still up in the air.
<li>
"Diagonal" moves (moving in one direction while pushing in a
perpendicular direction) are not supported. The keyboard-handling
needs to be changed to deal with multiple keypresses in order to make
this work.

There ought to be a way to return to the file list, instead of having
to shut down and restart the program. That drives me crazy.
