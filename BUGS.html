Bugs in the MS game logic emulation
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Several of the weirder obscure bugs aren't reproduced faithfully. (For
example, the tank-hits-red-button-cloning-block-which-hits-blue-button
bug correctly produces an extra tank in the emulation, but the first
tank still gets turned around.) For the most part, I'm not
particularly motivated to improve the emulation of these, as they are
pretty obscure. However, their existence may point to areas where the
emulator could be mirroring the internal logic of the MS game better.
<li>
The keyboard is scanned twice per tick, once at the beginning and once
in the middle. As a result, if Chip makes a move at the beginning of a
tick, the game does not update the display twice in a row (once after
the creatures move and once after Chip moves), but just does it once.
In a few places this has a non-trivial effect on how the game appears,
most notably when Chip tries to move against a force floor. I do not
believe that this optimization ever has an real effect on the
gameplay, however. It is still a bit of an open question in my mind,
however, which is why it is mentioned here.

Bugs in the Lynx game logic emulation

<li>
The pattern of "clone boosting" is not the same as the Lynx game.
It's hard to find examples that clearly show this; I have only one.
Play ICE HOUSE (102) on the Lynx. After landing safely on the red
button, step right to block off the teeth clones. Stay there. When the
clock reads 130 seconds or so, there will be a fireball clone that is
boosted. It will cross the ice just before a glider comes through, and
the glider will continue on its way past the red button. However, in
the emuluator, the fireball clone is not boosted. As a result, it is
still squarely on the ice when the glider arrives, and the latter
bounces off and retreats. The boosting pattern is governed by how
slots in the creature list come back up for reuse after a creature has
been killed. Clearly, the emulator is not using the same algorithm as
the Lynx game. Unfortunately, it's a tedious business to collect any
amount of data on this that would be necessary to start finding
patterns, and there are few levels that have the necessary elements
for such investigation. So this one is still up in the air.
<li>
"Diagonal" moves (moving in one direction while pushing in a
perpendicular direction) are not supported. The keyboard-handling
needs to be changed to deal with multiple keypresses in order to make
this work.
<li>
The Lynx game only permitted 128 creatures (including Chip) to exist
simultaneously. Thus, a clone machine activated when the population
was at maximum would "run out". The emulator does not enforce any such
maximum. Of course, fixing this would put a limit on the kinds of new
levels that people could create under the Lynx ruleset -- so this one
may be better off as it is....
<li>
On levels where Chips starts out on a force floor, if he begins the
level without moving, the force floor doesn't take effect until after
the first frame. In the emulation, the force floor takes effect from
the get-go.

Animated tiles, for display under the Lynx ruleset, has yet to be
completed. Ways to organize the images in a single bitmap, and to keep
them loaded without requiring excessive memory, need to be chosen.
