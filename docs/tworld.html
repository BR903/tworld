<p>
<p>
Tile World is a reimplementation of the game "Chip's Challenge". The
player controls Chip, navigating him through his challenges. The
object of each level of the game is to find and reach the exit tile,
which takes you to the next level. The levels contain many different
kinds of obstacles, creatures both hostile and indifferent, tools,
protective gear -- and, of course, chips.

<h3>
<a name="overview">Overview of the Game</a>
</h3>
<p>
The main display shows Chip in the current level and his immediate
surroundings. To the right of this display is shown the basic
information about the current level. The most important data shown
here are how many seconds are left on the clock, and how many chips
still need to be collected. (On some level the clock does not show a
time. These levels have no time limit.)
<p>
The object of every level is to find and reach the exit before the
time runs out. The exit is frequently (but not always) guarded by a
chip socket. To move past the chip socket, Chip must collect a certain
number of computer chips; the amount needed is different in each
level. As you play a level, the information display on the right shows
the number of chips that still need to be collected in order to open
the socket. (Remember that getting enough chips to open the chip
socket is only a subgoal, not the main goal. Some levels do not
require any chips to be collected; some levels have no chip socket at
all.)
<p>
Also occupying many of the levels are other creatures. Most (but not
all) of them move about in simple, predictable patterns, and without
regard for Chip's presence. The creatures know enough to avoid running
into each other, but a collision with Chip is fatal. The complete
taxonomy of creatures is: tanks, balls, gliders, fireballs, walkers,
blobs, teeth, bugs, and paramecia.
<p>
In addition to the socket and the main exit, there are also four
different kinds of doors. These doors can be opened with the right
kind of key. The doors and the keys are color-coded -- red, green,
blue, and yellow -- so you can tell them apart. Like the chip socket,
a door that has been opened stays open. Keys are picked up simply by
stepping upon them. The key disappears from the map and appears in
your possession. Keys in your possession are displayed on the
right-hand side of the window.
<p>
Besides keys and chip, there are also four kinds of special footgear
that Chip can collect. Like keys, boots can be picked up simply by
walking over them. (There is no limit to the number of boots you can
have.) These boots permit Chip to walk across four different kinds of
surfaces, just as if they were normal flooring. Fire and water are two
kind of tiles that are normally fatal to Chip, but fire boots and
water boots will permit safe passage across these. Stepping onto ice
sends Chip sliding at high speed unless he has a pair of ice boots.
Finally, there are force floors that push Chip along in a specific
direction; these can be counteracted with force boots.
<p>
Two other types of surfaces are more useful to Chip, in that they keep
other creatures out. These are dirt and gravel, and they are special
in that Chip is the only one who can walk on them. However, when Chip
steps onto a dirt tile, it is cleared away and becomes normal
flooring. Gravel, on the other hand, is permanent.
<p>
There are numerous other objects scattered around the various levels,
which Chip can interact with, although he cannot pick them up. Bombs
are one kind of object which should always be avoided, as they explode
when stepped on. The thief tile should also generally be avoided;
entering this tile will cause Chip to lose any footgear he has
collected.
<p>
Dirt blocks are large, movable squares of dirt. Chip can push them
about, and use them to wall off areas or to safely detontate bombs.
Furthermore, if a block is pushed into water, the tile will turn into
dirt (which will become normal flooring when Chip steps on it).
Finally, note that blocks can sometimes be resting on top of other
objects, both helpful (such as a key) and harmful (such as a bomb).
<p>
Some levels have teleports. Entering a teleport causes Chip to vanish
and instantaneously reappear at another teleport.
<p>
Even some of the walls can demonstrate surprising behavior. The
so-called blue walls can either be actual walls, or empty mirages.
The only way for Chip to tell which is which is to attempt to walk
through one. There are also popup walls -- Chip can walk across these
only once, for they turn into walls as he walks over them.
<p>
There are four different types of pushbuttons. Like keys and boots,
they are color-coded. Stepping on a pushbutton activates it.
<p>
The green buttons control the toggle walls. Toggle walls have dotted
green outlines, and they change between being open (passable, like any
other floor) and open (unpassable, a wall). When a green button is
pressed, the closed toggle walls are opened and the open toggle walls
are closed.
<p>
Brown buttons control bear traps. Anything that wanders into a bear
trap will be stuck there until the brown button connected to it is
pushed.
<p>
Blue buttons exercise some control over the tanks. Normally, a tank
moves directly forward until it hits an obstacle, whereupon it stops.
But when a blue button is pressed, all tanks turn around 180 degrees
and begin moving again.
<p>
The objects with the most potential for help and hindrance are the
clone machines, which are controlled by red buttons. Every clone
machine contains a dirt block, a tank, or some other creature. When
the clone machine's red button is pressed, a duplicate of whatever the
clone machine contains is created and set loose.
<p>
Once in a while there will also be hint buttons. These have a question
mark displayed on them. When Chip steps onto a hint button, a short
bit of information will be displayed in the lower right-hand area of
the window.
<p>
Here are some general hints for successful play:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
When moving dirt blocks around, take care not to shove them into
corners where you can't get them out again.
<li>
On some of the more mazelike levels, you may need to sketch out a map
in order to solve it.
<li>
Many of the creatures move in specific patterns (for example, as with
the tanks mentioned above).
<li>
A number of the objects in the game will affect other creatures in the
same way they affect Chip.
<li>
Remember that if you get trapped somewhere, you can always use
<tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>R</tt> to restart a level.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>
<a name="passwords">Passwords</a>
</h3>
<p>
Every level has a four-letter password. The password for a level is
shown in the information display at the upper-right of the window. The
obstensible purpose of passwords is to allow you to come back to a
level. Howver, normally you will never need to remember passwords, as
Tile World will automatically store the passwords for you. However, if
you somehow manage to learn the password of a level that you have yet
to achieve, you can use the password to gain early access to that
level.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="scoring">Scoring</a>
</h3>
<p>
For each level in a set that you complete, the game awards 500 points
times the level's number. Furthermore, if the level is timed, an extra
10 points is added for every second left on the clock when you finish
the level. You can thus sometimes improve your score by returning to
already-completed levels and playing them again.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="keycmds">Key Commands</a>
</h3>
<p>
During game play, the arrows are the most important keys; they move
Chip through the level. The keys <tt>2</tt> <tt>4</tt> <tt>6</tt>
<tt>8</tt> on the numeric keypad can also be used for the same
purpose. Other keys have the following functions:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>H</tt></td>
<td>
pauses the game; press any key to resume play.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>N</tt></td>
<td>
stops the current game and moves forward to the next level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>P</tt></td>
<td>
stops the current game and moves back to the previous level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Q</tt></td>
<td>
quits the current level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>R</tt></td>
<td>
starts over at the beginning of the current level. 
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>?</tt></td>
<td>
pauses the game and displays a list of topics for which help is
available within the program.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>V</tt></td>
<td>
decreases the volume level. (If the volume level is reduced to zero,
then the program will display sound effects textually, as
onomatopoeia.)
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Shift</tt>-<tt>V</tt></td>
<td>
increases the volume level.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
At the start of a level, before game play begins, the following key
commands are available:
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><tt>Q</tt></td>
<td>
returns to the list of available level sets.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Spc</tt></td>
<td>
starts the current level without moving (i.e., standing still).
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>N</tt></td>
<td>
moves to the next level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>P</tt></td>
<td>
moves to the previous level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>PgUp</tt></td>
<td>
moves ahead ten levels.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>PgDn</tt></td>
<td>
moves back ten levels.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>G</tt></td>
<td>
displays a prompt and accepts a password, then jumps to the level with
that password.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>I</tt></td>
<td>
plays back the best solution for that level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>X</tt></td>
<td>
deprecates the best solution for that level. If the level is then
succesfully completed again, the saved solution will be replaced with
the new one, whether or not it had a better time.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>S</tt></td>
<td>
displays the list of known levels and their current scores. The score
list also permits changing the current level.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>?</tt></td>
<td>
displays a list of topics for which help is available within the
program.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
At most other points, the <tt>Q</tt> key will abort the current activity
and return to the start of the current level.
<p>
Finally, the program can be exited at any time by pressing either
<tt>Ctrl</tt>-<tt>C</tt> or <tt>Alt</tt>-<tt>F4</tt>.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="rulesets">Rulesets</a>
</h3>
Tile World contains emulators for two different versions of "Chip's
Challenge". They are referred to as the Lynx ruleset and the MS
ruleset. The Lynx ruleset recreates the original implementation of the
game, and the MS ruleset recreates the version that was implemented
for Microsoft Windows (cf <a href="#history">History</a>).
<p>
The most notable difference between the two rulesets is that in the MS
ruleset, movement between tiles is instantaneous, whereas under the
Lynx ruleset motion occurs across several "ticks". (This probably
reflects the fact that the latter ran on dedicated hardware, while the
former ran on 33 MHz PCs under a non-preemptive multitasking OS.)
Although the basic mechanics of the game are the same under both
rulesets, there are also a host of subtle differences between the two.
<p>
Each level set file includes a flag that indicates which ruleset it is
to be played under. Some level sets can be played under both rulesets
(most notably, the original set of levels), but this is the exception.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="newsets">Adding New Level Sets</a>
</h3>
<p>
Level sets are defined by data files. By convention these file are
named with a <tt>.dat</tt> extension. Typically the name proper contains
the author's first name, last initial, and a single digit -- for
example, <tt>EricS1.dat</tt>. (The digit is used to give the sequence in
case the author, for whatever reason, stores their creations in more
than one file.)
<p>
When a new data file is obtained, it may simply be copied into the
level set directory (cf <a href="#directories">Directories</a>), and
Tile World will then make it available for playing.
<p>
An alternate method is to use a configuration file (see
<a href="#configfiles">Configuration Files</a> below).
<p>
<h3>
<a name="options">Command-Line Options</a>
</h3>
<p>
<tt>tworld</tt> [<tt>-hvVdlstpqH</tt>] [<tt>-DLRS</tt> <i>DIR</i>]
[<i>LEVEL-SET</i>] [<i>LEVEL-NUMBER</i>]
<p>
<tt>tworld</tt> is normally invoked without arguments. The program
begins by displaying a list of the available level sets. After a level
set is chosen, the program jumps to the first unsolved level to begin
play. However, the name of a level set can be specified directly on
the command line, as well as the number of a level to start with.
<p>
The available command-line options are enumerated in the following
table. (Windows users: The options that cause the program to display
something on standard output actually go to a file named
<tt>stdout.txt</tt> instead.)
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;<i>DIR</i></td>
<td>
Read level data files from <i>DIR</i> instead of the default
directory.
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-d</tt></td>
<td>
Display the default directories used by the program on standard
output, and exit.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-H</tt></td>
<td>
Upon exit, display a histogram of idle time on standard output. (This
option is used for evaluating optimization efforts.)
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-h</tt></td>
<td>
Display a summary of the command-line syntax on standard output and
exit.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-L</tt>&nbsp;<i>DIR</i></td>
<td>
Look for level sets in <i>DIR</i> instead of the default directory.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-l</tt></td>
<td>
Write a list of available level sets to standard output and exit.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-p</tt></td>
<td>
Turn off all password-checking. This option allows the normal sequence
of levels to be bypassed.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-q</tt></td>
<td>
Run quietly. All sounds, including the ringing of the terminal bell,
are suppressed.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-R</tt>&nbsp;<i>DIR</i></td>
<td>
Read resource data from <i>DIR</i> instead of the default directory.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-S</tt>&nbsp;<i>DIR</i></td>
<td>
Read and write solution files under <i>DIR</i> instead of the default
directory.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-s</tt></td>
<td>
Display the current scores for the selected level set on standard
output and exit. (A level set must be specified on the command line
for this option to be generally useful.)
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-t</tt></td>
<td>
Display the best times for the selected level set on standard output
and exit. (A level set must be specified on the command line for this
option to be generally useful.)
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-V</tt></td>
<td>
Display the program's version and license information on standard
output and exit.
</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>-v</tt></td>
<td>
Display the program's version number on standard output and exit.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<h3>
<a name="configfiles">Configuration Files</a>
</h3>
<p>
Configuration files are used to override some of the settings in a
data file, or to set values not provided for by the data file format.
Configuration files are by convention named with a <tt>.dac</tt>
extension. A configuration file is stored in the level set directory
in the place of the data file, which then goes into the data directory
(cf <a href="#directories">Directories</a>).
<p>
The configuration file is a simple text file. The first line of a
configuration file <em>must</em> have the following form:
<p>
<tt>file = </tt><i>DATAFILE</i>
<p>
where <i>DATAFILE</i> is the filename of the data file. (Arbitrary
whitespace is permitted around the equal sign, but there cannot be any
whitespace embedded at the beginning of the line.) After this initial
line, the configuration file can contain any of the following lines:
<p>
<tt>usepasswords = </tt><i>y/n</i>
<p>
This line permits password-checking to be enabled/disabled when
playing the levels in the set. The default is <tt>y</tt>.
<p>
<tt>ruleset = </tt><i>ms/lynx</i>
<p>
This line allows the configuration file to override the ruleset
setting in the data file. This is mainly useful in the case where one
level set is playable under either ruleset (as is the case with the
original level set). The author can then provide one data file and two
configuration files to make both versions available.
<p>
<tt>lastlevel = </tt><i>levelnum</i>
<p>
This line marks an arbitrary level as being the last level in the
set. The game will stop when this level is completed, instead of
proceeding to the next level. (Note that if the data file contains any
levels beyond this one, they will only be reachable via a password.)
<p>
<h3>
<a name="resources">Resources</a>
</h3>
<p>
Tile World loads various resources at runtime from its resource
directory (cf <a href="#directories">Directories</a>). These
resources include the program's font, graphic images, and sound
effects. The actual files that it loads is determined by the contents
of a file named <tt>rc</tt> (short for "resource configuration", not
"runtime commands") in the same directory.
<p>
The <tt>rc</tt> file is a plain text file, and contains lines of the
form
<p>
<i>resource</i><tt> = </tt><i>filename</i>
<p>
where <i>resource</i> is a symbolic resource name, and <i>filename</i>
is the name of a file in the resource directory.
<p>
The resources can be set differently depending on the ruleset that the
program is using. A line in the <tt>rc</tt> file of the form
<p>
<tt>[</tt><i>ruleset</i><tt>]</tt>
<p>
indicates that the lines that follow only apply when that ruleset is
in effect (where <i>ruleset</i> is either <tt>MS</tt> or
<tt>Lynx</tt>). Resources that are defined before any such line apply
to both rulesets, and are also used as fallbacks if a ruleset-specific
resource could not be loaded. (The font and the text-color resources
also need to have ruleset-independent values, as these are used when
the program is displaying the initial file list.)
<p>
A line of the form
<p>
<tt>TileImages = </tt><i>FILENAME</i>
<p>
identifies the file that provides the images used to draw the game.
These images are stored in a Windows bitmap. The layout of this bitmap
is documented <a href="tilebmp.html">here</a>.
<p>
A line of the form
<p>
<tt>Font = </tt><i>FILENAME</i>
<p>
identifies the file that provides the program's font. The font is
stored as a Windows bitmap. The layout of this bitmap is documented
<a href="fontbmp.html">here</a>.
<p>
Four resources define the colors used in rendering text:
<p>
<tt>BackgroundColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>TextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>BoldTextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<br>
<tt>DimTextColor = </tt><i>RRGGBB</i>
<p>
The value of <i>RRGGBB</i> is a string of six hexadecimal digits
defining the red, green, and blue values of the color (as with the
color specification used in HTML or X Windows, but without the
preceding octothorpe).
<p>
The remaining resources all define the game's sound effects. The
sounds are stored as Microsoft .wav (RIFF) files. Unlike the tile
images, each sound effect is defined as a separate file. The complete
list of symbolic resource names is as follows:
<p>
<ul>
Sounds used in both rulesets
<li><tt>LevelCompleteSound</tt>
<li><tt>ChipDeathSound</tt>
<li><tt>BlockedMoveSound</tt>
<li><tt>PickupToolSound</tt>
<li><tt>ThiefSound</tt>
<li><tt>TeleportSound</tt>
<li><tt>OpenDoorSound</tt>
<li><tt>SocketSound</tt>
<li><tt>SwitchSound</tt>
<li><tt>BombSound</tt>
<li><tt>SplashSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
Sounds used only under the MS ruleset
<li><tt>TickSound</tt>
<li><tt>ChipDeathByTimeSound</tt>
<li><tt>PickupChipSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
Sounds used only under the Lynx ruleset
<li><tt>TileEmptiedSound</tt>
<li><tt>WallCreatedSound</tt>
<li><tt>TrapEnteredSound</tt>
<li><tt>BlockMovingSound</tt>
<li><tt>SkatingForwardSound</tt>
<li><tt>SkatingTurnSound</tt>
<li><tt>SlidingSound</tt>
<li><tt>SlideWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>IceWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>WaterWalkingSound</tt>
<li><tt>FireWalkingSound</tt>
</ul>
<p>
(Note that the symbolic names for the shared and MS-only sounds match
the names in the <tt>entpack.ini</tt> file used by the Microsoft
program. This makes it easy for someone with a copy of Microsoft's
"Chip's Challenge" to use the sound effects that were provided with
that version of the game. In a similar vein, the bitmap stored in the
Microsoft executable can be used as the <tt>TileImages</tt> resource.)

<h3>
<a name="history">History</a>
</h3>
<p>
"Chip's Challenge" was created by Chuck Sommerville, and was
originally written for the Atari Lynx handheld game console. ("Tile
World" was his working title for the game.) "Chip's Challenge" was
published by Epyx (the company who designed the Lynx before selling
the rights to Atari) in 1989, and was among the first set of games
made available for the Lynx.
<p>
"Chip's Challenge" was subsequently ported to several other platforms:
MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Amiga, and the Commodore 64. (A NES port
was also planned, but never completed.) The most well-known port was
the Windows version, done by Microsoft and sold as part of Windows
Entertainment Pack 4 (and later as part of Best of Windows
Entertainment Pack).
<p>
In the process of recreating the game for the 16-bit Windows platform,
Microsoft introduced a surprising number of changes to the mechanics
of the game. Some were clearly intentional, some were done through
ignorance or indifference, and others were simply bugs in the program.
<p>
The programs in WEP4 came pre-installed on many PC computers sold
during the 1990s, which is part of the reason for its widespread
popularity. A small but fanatically loyal community of adherents to
the game connected via a MSN chatroom (and later through the
internet). A few members of this community managed to decipher the
format of the MS game's data file, and John K. Elion subsequently
created a freeware level editor, called ChipEdit. As a result there
are now dozens of new level sets, created by fans of the game and all
freely available.
<p>
Atari discontinued support for the Lynx in 1994. When Epyx went under,
the rights to their games were purchased by Bridgestone Multimedia.
Responding to the success of "Chip's Challenge", Chuck Sommerville
created a sequel ("Chip's Challenge 2"). The sequel included the
original game as a proper subset, and Bridgestone holds the rights to
both games. Unfortunately, the company has not seen fit to actually
release "Chip's Challenge 2", and by now it is highly unlikely that
they ever will. Since Chuck Sommerville no longer has rights to either
game, and Microsoft no longer sells either of the Entertainment Packs,
"Chip's Challenge" is no longer available (except by purchasing a used
version, or obtaining an illegal copy of same).
<p>
In 2001, the author began writing "Tile World" with the intention of
recreating a version of the MS game for the Linux platform. At the
encouragement of Chuck Sommerville, this project was expanded to
include the goals of recreating the original Lynx game as well, and
also making the program work under MS Windows in addition to Linux.
<p>
<h3>
<a name="nomenclature">Notes on Nomenclature</a>
</h3>
<p>
"Chip's Challenge" has seen several incarnations. Each had its own
graphical rendering, and thus many of the objects in the game are
known by more than one name. For example, the four types of boots in
the MS version of the game were known as fire boots, flippers (for
water), skates (for ice), and suction boots (for force floors). In the
original Lynx version, however, they were not even boots -- the four
tools were fire shields, water shields, cleats, and magnets,
respectively.
<p>
Several of the creatures have seen a variety of names. The list of
creatures given in <a href="#overview">Overview of the Game</a>
corresponds to the MS version of the game. In the original Lynx
version, the paramecia were centipedes instead. In still other
versions of the game, gliders were referred to as ghosts or sharks,
fireballs were flames, and teeth were called frogs. (You will also
occasionally see bugs referred to as bees, and walkers referred to as
dumbbells.)
<p>
Finally, the thief tile was called a spy in the MS version.
<p>
None of this information is needed in order to play the game, but it
helps to explain the titles of some of the user-created levels.
