.section Lynx Ruleset Differences

The Lynx ruleset emulation intentionally diverges from the original in
a few minor aspects. The most noticeable of the differences are as
follows:

.list
. On the Atari Lynx, no more than 128 creatures could exist at one
time. Attempting to create a 129th creature with a clone machine
would cause it to "run out". Tile World imposes no such limit.
. On the Atari Lynx, there were no Wall North or Wall West tiles.
These two tiles were introduced by the MS version, even though they do
not appear in the original level set. Tile World nonetheless permits
these tiles to be used in Lynx levels.
. The Atari Lynx did not permit arbitrary wiring of buttons. Brown
buttons were automatically connected to the next bear trap in reading
order (scanning to the right, then along the next row going down, and
restarting at the top if the bottom is reached, until a beartrap is
found), and likewise with red buttons and clone machines. Tile World
follows the explicit wiring information present in the data file.

These differences were specifically allowed to stand because they are
aspects of the game that are rarely or never addressed by the original
level set, and were felt by the community at the time to be more like
artifacts of the implementation than intentional features of the
original design.

These differences, however, can be suppressed by running Tile World in
"pedantic mode". (See the documentation for <-P> under #Command-Line
Options# above.) Thus for example in pedantic mode Tile World's Lynx
ruleset imposes a maximum of 128 creatures, ignores wiring data in the
data file, and refuses to play levels containing the new wall tiles.
