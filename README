Welcome to Tile World
---------------------

Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the
Atari Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS
Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).

This is the fourth alpha release of Tile World. There is still a bit
of work left to be done before beta, but the program is quite usable
as it currently stands.

Note that Tile World requires the SDL library. The Windows
distribution includes a copy of the SDL library (version 1.2.2). SDL
can be downloaded from http://www.libsdl.org/download.html.

See the INSTALL file for further directions on getting the program set
up and running.

Tile World is an emulation of the game engines only. It does not come
with the chips.dat level file, which is copyrighted and cannot be
freely distributed. If you do not own a copy of chips.dat, however,
you can still play Tile World with the freely available level files
created by fans of the original game.

Bugs
----

At this time I am unaware of any bugs in the support code (e.g., the
code that finds and lists the available data files, calculates scores,
and so on), though I'm sure some are there. Bugs in the game logic, on
the other hand, definitely do exist. See the BUGS file for details.

Bug reports should either be sent to me at <breadbox@muppetlabs.com>,
or posted to the newsgroup. (However, try to place such posts under an
existing thread regarding the clone. And take a moment to verify that
the bug has not already been described in a previous post.)
