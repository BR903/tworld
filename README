Installing
----------

Edit the Makefile and change the definition of DATADIR to point to the
directory containing your .dat files. (Or omit it to use the default
value of /usr/local/share/chips.)

As with all svgalib programs, you need to run make as root.

Once compiled, use ./chips -h for help with cmdline options.
