"Chip! Where are you?!"
</p>

<p>
Chip McCallahan slowly opened his eyes, put on his spectacles, and made his way toward the front door, coughing as he went.
His hair was white and he walked with a limp.
</p>

<p>
But this was only because he'd just fallen off the kitchen table and upset a can of flour over himself
 while trying to reach the jar of cookies on the top shelf.
That was pretty much all the excitement he'd had that week.
Even though he still had a lot of fun at the parties that some of the Bit Busters organized every once in a while,
 he missed the exciting days of exploring the two clubhouses that Melinda and the Bit Busters had built.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, Chip!!" Melinda exclaimed as he opened the door.
"Look at you! I'm not letting you into the new clubhouse like <em>that</em>!!"
</p>

<p>
Chip's jaw dropped. "New... New clubhouse?! Did you say 'new clubhouse'??"
</p>

<p>
"Yes I did," said Melinda. "You'd better get ready if you're up for the challenge."
</p>

<p>
"Boy, am I ever!!" Chip declared, starting to dust himself.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," Melinda continued,
"the clubhouse also has an exclusive Bit Busters' lounge where you can drop in between levels.
 I'll be there too, keeping an eye on your progress..."
</p>

<p>
Soon, Chip found himself at the doors of the third clubhouse in his illustrious career.
Would he be able to solve all of its puzzles?

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>
The CCLP3 package contains the following files:-
</p>

<table summary="Names and descriptions of files">
<tr>
<td><tt>data/CCLP3.dat</tt></td>
<td>The main levelset data file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>data/CCLP3.ccx</tt></td>
<td>Story and author information file for Tile World 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>sets/*.dac</tt></td>
<td>Configuration files for Tile World</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>CCLP3.html</tt></td>
<td>This documentation file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>cclp3res/</tt></td>
<td>Images and other supporting files for this documentation</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Using Tile World</h4>

<p>
To play CCLP3 using
<a href="http://madhavshanbhag.sitesled.com/Landlubber/TileWorld/index.html">Tile World 2</a>
or
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/">Tile World</a>,
just copy the <tt>data</tt> and <tt>sets</tt> directories to Tile World's standard location for these files.
On Windows, this is the directory where Tile World has been installed.
On Linux, the default location is <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>.
</p>
<p>
With Tile World, you have the choice of playing CCLP3 under either the original Lynx ruleset
 (which also features animated gameplay),
or under the MS ruleset (as in Microsoft Chip's Challenge).
Tile World also records your solutions automatically and lets you play them back later.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Playing using Tile World 2 is recommended as it will also display CCLP3's story within the game.
</p>
-->

<h4>Using Microsoft Chip's Challenge (MSCC)</h4>

<p>
To play CCLP3 using the Microsoft version of Chip's Challenge, all you need is the <tt>CCLP3.dat</tt> file
 from the <tt>data</tt> folder.
To make MSCC use this file, you will need a program such as
<a href="http://cctools.translucentdragon.com/">CCTools</a>,
<a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/controls/">Chip's Controls</a>
or
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~a_magical_me/newsite/chip/MyChips.zip">MyChips</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that MSCC is a 16-bit Windows program that will not run on other operating systems such as Linux and Mac OSX,
 and requires additional steps to run smoothly on 64-bit Windows
<small>(more information <a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/64bit.html">here</a>)</small>.

<h3>The Story</h3>

<p>
The story continues as Chip makes his way through challenge after challenge.
</p>

<p>
If you're using Tile World 2 and have installed the <tt>CCLP3.ccx</tt> file,
 the story will be displayed within the game.

<br>
- for designing levels and offering them for inclusion in CCLP3.
Due to the number of levels in the set being limited,
 some designers could not have their creations included in CCLP3,
 but they certainly offered some stiff competition to the ones that did.
The detailed list of levels and authors can be found <a href="cclp3res/c.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
John Elion, Michael Hansen, Christopher Elsby and Yongyi Chen - for developing the excellent level editors
 using which these levels could be made.
</p>

<p>
Brian Raiter - for creating Tile World, thereby making both the Lynx and MS modes of Chip's Challenge available
 for playing on the various operating systems in use today.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Sommerville - for creating that amazing, timeless, classic game called Chip's Challenge.
