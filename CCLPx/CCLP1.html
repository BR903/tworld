Chip, <i>he thought.</i> Yes, that's my name. But who's that shouting? And where am I?

<i>Groping for his glasses and staggering to his feet, he looked around, quickly spotting the loudspeaker in the ceiling that let in the urgent voice. Would it let him answer? Clearing his unnaturally parched throat, he croaked, "Hello?"</i>

<tr>
<td><tt>data/CCLP1.dat</tt></td>
<td>The main levelset data file</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>data/CCLP1.ccx</tt></td>
<td>Story and author information file for Tile World 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<h4>Using Tile World</h4>

<p>
To play CCLP1 using
<a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/TW2/download.html">Tile World 2</a>
or
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/">Tile World</a>,
just copy the <tt>data</tt> and <tt>sets</tt> directories to Tile World's standard location for these files.
On Windows, this is the directory where Tile World has been installed.
On Linux, the default location is <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>.
</p>
<p>
With Tile World, you have the choice of playing CCLP1 under either the original Lynx ruleset
 (which also features animated gameplay),
or under the MS ruleset (as in Microsoft Chip's Challenge).
Tile World also records your solutions automatically and lets you play them back later.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Playing using Tile World 2 is recommended as it will also display CCLP1's story within the game.
</p>
-->

<h4>Using Microsoft Chip's Challenge (MSCC)</h4>

<p>
To play CCLP1 using the Microsoft version of Chip's Challenge, all you need is the <tt>CCLP1.dat</tt> file
 from the <tt>data</tt> folder.
To make MSCC use this file, you will need a program such as
<a href="http://cctools.translucentdragon.com/">CCTools</a>,
<a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/controls/">Chip's Controls</a>
or
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~a_magical_me/newsite/chip/MyChips.zip">MyChips</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that MSCC is a 16-bit Windows program that will not run on other operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X,
 and requires additional steps to run smoothly on 64-bit Windows
<small>(more information <a href="http://www.pillowpc2001.net/64bit.html">here</a>)</small>.

<h3>The Story</h3>

<p>
The story continues as Chip makes his way through challenge after challenge.
</p>

<p>
If you're using Tile World 2 and have installed the <tt>CCLP1.ccx</tt> file,
 the story will be displayed within the game.

<br>
- for designing levels and offering them for inclusion in CCLP1.
Due to the number of levels in the set being limited,
 some designers could not have their creations included in CCLP1,
 but they certainly offered some stiff competition to the ones that did.
The detailed list of levels and authors can be found <a href="cclp1res/c.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
John Elion, Christopher Elsby, Michael Hansen, and Yongyi Chen - for developing the excellent level editors
 using which these levels could be made.
</p>

<p>
Brian Raiter, Madhav Shanbhag, and Eric Schmidt - for developing Tile World, thereby making both the Lynx and MS modes of Chip's Challenge available
 for playing on the various operating systems in use today.
</p>

<p>
Chuck Sommerville - for creating that amazing, timeless, classic game called Chip's Challenge.
