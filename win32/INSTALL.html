<p>
There's no automatic installer yet, so you will need to do this
manually.
<p>
First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive
into its own separate directory. So, if you haven't already done so,
create a new directory (what Windows calls folders) for this --
something like <tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp></tt> -- and extract the
files there.
<p>
Then, find your copy of the <tt>chips.dat</tt> data file. Copy this to
the <tt>data</tt> subdirectory:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy chips.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\data</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have other data files that you would like to try out in the
clone, copy those to the <tt>sets</tt> directory instead:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\my\collection\of\dat\files</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy *.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\sets</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
(The reason for using different directories is that <tt>chips.dat</tt>
makes use of configuration files. Note that you don't need to know how
configuration files work to use Tile World.)
<p>
That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp>\tworld</tt>, or create a shortcut for it.
<p>
Note that Tile World does not use the mouse; everything is done with
the keyboard. You can type "?" while a game is being displayed to see
a description of what the keys do. Or, you can read the instructions
found in the <tt>tworld.html</tt>.
<p>
<h3>mklynxcc.com</h3>
<p>
A very simple command-line utility is included called
<tt>mklynxcc</tt>. This program will change a normal data file to one
that will use the Lynx ruleset when played. By making a copy of a data
file and running this utility on the copy, you can see how those
levels work (or don't work) under the Lynx ruleset.
