<p>
There's no automatic installer yet, so you will need to do this
manually.
<p>
First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive
into its own separate directory. So, if you haven't already done so,
create a new directory (what Windows calls folders) for this --
something like <tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp></tt> -- and extract the
files there.
<p>
Then, find your copy of the <tt>chips.dat</tt> data file. Copy this to
the <tt>data</tt> subdirectory:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy chips.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\data</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have other data files that you might like to try out in the
clone, copy those over as well.
<p>
(You can probably do all of this more quickly using Windows Explorer,
but I don't know enough about that program to give you directions
there.)
<p>
That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp>\tworld</tt>, or create a shortcut for it.
<p>
Note that Tile World does not use the mouse; everything is done with
the keyboard. You can type "?" while a game is being displayed to see
a description of what the keys do.
<p>
<h3>mklynxcc.com</h3>
<p>
A very simple command-line utility is included called
<tt>mklynxcc</tt>. This program will change a normal data file to one
that will use the Lynx ruleset when played. By making a copy of a data
file and running this utility on the copy, you can see how the levels
work (or don't work) with the Lynx ruleset.
<p>
However, the main purpose of this utility is to create a Lynx version
of the original <tt>chips.dat</tt>, so you can play the original
version of the game, as it existed before Microsoft came into the
picture. When you run this utility on your <tt>chips.dat</tt> file
(make a separate copy first), include the <tt>-x</tt> option, like so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>copy chips.dat <samp>lynxchip.dat</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>mklynxcc -x <samp>lynxchip.dat</samp></tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
This will have the added effect on the data file of restoring the wall
on level 88 (SPIRALS) that Microsoft removed, assuming your
<tt>chips.dat</tt> is one of those with a removed wall. (It will also
fix the four passwords that were changed from the original Lynx codes
-- levels 7, 10, 28, and 96.) The resulting data file will thus
provide a more accurate emulation of the original game. (Though not
perfect -- to be perfect it should remove level 145 and replace it
with a fractal generator.)
