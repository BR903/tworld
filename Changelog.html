<body>
<p>
200? ??? ??: version 0.9.3
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Added a proper Chip-dies sequence to the Lynx emulation.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Dec 27: version 0.9.2
<p>
<ul>
<li>
A couple more memory leaks fixed (these inside of SDL).
<li>
New tile bitmap format, which permits the use of animated tiles.
<li>
A couple of stupid crashes that slipped into the previous version have
been repaired.
<li>
Miscellaneous other tweaks.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Dec 07: version 0.9.1
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Added the ability to return to the initial file display. At last!
<li>
Full-scale assault on the code to weed out memory leaks. (In my
defense, the majority of them technically weren't leaks before the
prior change was implemented.)
<li>
Added -t option (unfortunately it's not as useful as I'd hoped it
would be).
<li>
Fixed segfault when trying to play back solution on an unsolved
level.
<li>
Improved the onomatopoeia display.
<li>
Reorganized the online help.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Dec 03: version 0.9.0
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Found and fixed the obscure slide delay bug that was causing the
discrepancy in Eric Schmidt's level 29 ("PARAMECIA")!
<li>
Threw out all the text-drawing code and replaced it with routines that
deal in proportional fonts. Which naturally necessitated rewriting a
bunch of the code that displayed text. Lots of changes. Created an
abstract table "object", so that my tables could be realized either on
the text console or in a proportional font equally well.
<li>
Implemented sound! Spent an entire weekend making 25 wave files -- and
they still sound ridiculous. (But the fact that the game finally has
sound is nice.) Onomatopoeia is still available via a cmdline switch.
<li>
Added password-checking code, plus functions to allow the user to jump
to a level by entering a password.
<li>
Changed the save file format (again!) to store password information,
and to be a little smaller.
<li>
Added the configuration file feature, with a few configuration
options. This necessitated adding yet another directory, and once
again moving the old one.
<li>
Various bug fixes that I've forgotten about while working on all the
other things.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Nov 14: version 0.8.4
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Rewrote a lot of the display code to avoid redundant drawing of areas
of the screen. Didn't really make it faster, but I did make it more to
my liking. Also rewrote all of the text display code.
<li>
Removed gamestate data that was only needed by one of the logic
modules and made it private to that module.
<li>
Fixed bug found by Mike L. regarding the ordering of clones (MS).
<li>
Fixed bug regarding Chip trying to move on random force floors (MS).
<li>
Added code to indicate when Chip is pushing (Lynx).
</ul>
<p>
2001 Nov 10: version 0.8.3
<p>
<ul>
<li>
MS logic bug fix (clone machine would get stuck if clone died while
exiting).
<li>
Mixed improvement of display code. (The really cool revamping of the
display code wound out performing horribly on 24-bit displays, and so
had to be tossed out.)
</ul>
<p>
2001 Nov 08: version 0.8.2
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Found problem with teleports (MS): creatures provide their own
teleport blockage! Fixed.
<li>
Careful investigation revealed more timing bugs with buttons,
teleports, and maybe beartraps as well (MS). Rewrote the endmovement()
function until everything was being done in the right order.
<li>
Added an "rc" file which can be edited to change the filenames of the
external resources.
<li>
Discovered and fixed a discrepancy in the slide delay (MS).
<li>
The usual sundry tweaks.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 29: version 0.8.1
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug introduced in 0.7.2, correctly this time.
<li>
Fixed intermittent memory corruption caused by an uninitialized stack
variable.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 28: version 0.8.0
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug introduced in 0.7.2 which caused Chip to "come to rest" when
he couldn't make a forced move (MS).
<li>
Fixed buried beartrap behavior in MS game logic.
<li>
Altered the solution file format (been wanting to do that for a long
time).
<li>
Gave the program an icon (a temporary one, until I can get someone to
make me a real icon).
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 23: version 0.7.2
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed two bugs in MS game logic discovered by Anders Kaseorg
(creatures entering random slide floors, and Chip causing slide
delay).
<li>
Rewrote the clone machine code to better match the internals of the MS
game (thanks to recent discoveries). Also fixed the red-button logic
so that clones do not block their own clone machines.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 22: version 0.7.1
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed bug in MS game logic found by Anders Kaseorg (button not
recognized when hit by a block being pushed by Chip while on the slip
list).
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 21: version 0.7.0
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Altered handling of the slip list in the MS game logic. Creatures on
the slip list now have their slip direction stored separately from
their pointed direction, and the former is determined at the time they
enter a tile, instead of just before moving off of it.
<li>
My first serious attempt at implementing slide delay!
<li>
Many little tweaks to the MS logic. I think it's getting close....
<li>
The tile images are no longer compiled into the binary; instead they
are loaded out of an external bitmap file. The rendering code was
changed to use 32-bit images internally instead of 8-bit images, so
that all types of bitmaps can be accepted.
<li>
Added a new shared subdirectory for holding the data files; the main
shared directory is now used to hold images.
<li>
Altered the onomatopoeia code to ease future introduction of sound.
<li>
Fixed the Lynx bug regarding the bequeathing of a slide token, or
rather the lack thereof, when Chip is at a force-floor dead end.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Oct 05: version 0.6.0
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Rewrote several fundamentals of the MS game logic, in order to bring
it more in line with MS's layered map, as well as its treatment of
blocks as non-creatures.
<li>
Made some general changes to the game internals in order to
accommodate the above changes.
<li>
Many tweaks and improvements to the MS game logic.
<li>
Added the Ctrl-X feature to permit replacement of saved games --
something I should have added a long time ago.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Aug 27: version 0.5.1
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Made some changes in the game-saving code to avoid an infinite loop
that was sometimes happening under Windows.
<li>
Fixed two bugs in MS game logic identified by Anders Kaseorg. (1.
Chip can only attempt to move once per tick -- a failed move still
counts. 2. Creatures moving onto the slide list make their first slide
move in the same tick.)
</ul>
<p>
2001 Aug 19: version 0.5
<p>
<ul>
<li>
First alpha version.
<li>
The SVGAlib layer has been replaced with a much more complete layer
for SDL. The program can now be compiled for either X or MS
Windows. (All hail SDL and gcc's cross-compiling capabilities!) SDL
also works under SVGAlib, but it looks terrible on my hardware.
<li>
A version of the game logic implementing the MS ruleset (with lots of
bugs) has been added. The program can now switch between the two
rulesets.
<li>
I ripped the entire code base apart and put it back together again
(except for the parts that were thrown out). The code is somewhat
better organized now.
<li>
Code was added to select data files, display scores, and lots of
little things all over the place.
<li>
Comments! They're still pretty skeletal, but they're better than what
was there before.
</ul>
<p>
2001 Jul 15: version 0.1
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The previous game logic has been replaced with a complete game logic
module for the Lynx ruleset.
<li>
The SVGAlib layer has been heavily rewritten to do raw keyboard
polling and smooth-scrolling.
<li>
Lots of other changes and bug fixes.
</ul>
<p>
2001 May 19: version 0.0
<p>
<ul>
<li>
First limited public release.
<li>
Most of the basic infrastructure is in place, including a working
draft of a game logic module.
</ul>
