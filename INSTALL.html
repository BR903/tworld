Installing Tile World for Linux

<p>
Before proceeding, ensure that you have SDL installed on your
machine. (If you don't have SDL, you can get it by visiting <a
href="http://www.libsdl.org/download.html">http://www.libsdl.org/download.html</a>.
If you download a precompiled version -- i.e., an .rpm or .deb file --
note that you will need the development runtime, as opposed to the
binary runtime.)
<p>
Installing Tile World involves the usual three-part incantation:
<p>
<h3>
./configure
</h3>
<p>
By default, the program is set up so that it will keep its shared
files in <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>. If you would prefer the
<tt>tworld</tt> directory to be somewhere besides
<tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, use the <tt>--datadir</tt> option to change
it when you run <tt>./configure</tt>. Alternately, you can use the
<tt>--with-sharedir=DIR</tt> option to explicitly specify a completely
different path. (This value can also be changed at runtime, either via
the <tt>TWORLDDIR</tt> environment variable or via the command line.)
<p>
<h3>
make
</h3>
<p>
There shouldn't be any serious warnings from the compiler. Use "make
all" if you want to also build a copy of <tt>mklynxcc</tt> (see
below).
<p>
<h3>
make install
</h3>
<p>
Running "make install" as root will do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld</tt> binary to <tt>/usr/local/games</tt>.
<li>
Create <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt> if it does not exist. (Or
whatever directory you specified to <tt>./configure</tt>.)
<li>
Copy the external resources (i.e., the bitmaps and wave files) to
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>.
<li>
Create an empty directory <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/data</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
This empty directory is where you will store the <tt>.dat</tt> files
that you want to use.
<p>
N.B.: With every alpha release, there is the possibility that one or
more of your saved games from a previous release will no longer work
correctly. This happens when your solution, knowingly or not, is
dependent on a bug in the emulation that has been fixed. When this
happens, you can use Ctrl-X to mark a solution as "replaceable", and
then play the level. When you solve it, your new solution will replace
the old one, whether or not it has a better time.
<p>
<h2>
mklynxcc
</h2>
<p>
A very simple command-line utility is included, called
<tt>mklynxcc</tt>. This program will change a normal <tt>.dat</tt>
file to one that will use the Lynx ruleset when played. By making a
copy of a <tt>.dat</tt> file and running this utility on the copy, you
can see how the levels work (or don't work) with the Lynx ruleset.
<p>
However, the main purpose of this utility is to create a Lynx version
of the original <tt>chips.dat</tt>, so you can play the original
version of the game. When you run this utility on your
<tt>chips.dat</tt> file (or rather, on a separate copy of your
<tt>chips.dat</tt> file), include the <tt>-x</tt> option. This will
have the added effect on the <tt>.dat</tt> file of restoring the wall
on level 88 (SPIRALS) that MS removed, assuming your
<tt>chips.dat</tt> is one of those with a removed wall. (It will also
fix the four passwords that were changed from the original Lynx codes
-- levels 7, 10, 28, and 96.) The resulting .dat file will thus
provide a more accurate emulation of the original game. (Though not
perfect -- to be perfect it should remove level 145 and replace it
with a fractal generator.)
