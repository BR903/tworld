Before proceeding, ensure that you have SDL 1.2 installed on your
machine. (If you don't have SDL, you can get it by visiting
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php">http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php</a>.
If you download a precompiled version -- i.e., an .rpm or .deb file --
note that you will need the development runtime, as opposed to the
binary runtime.)
<p>
Installing Tile World involves the usual three-part incantation:
<p>
<h3>
./configure
</h3>
<p>
By default, the program is set up so that it will keep its shared
files under <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>. If you would prefer the
<tt>tworld</tt> directory to be somewhere besides
<tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, use the <tt>--datarootdir</tt> option to
change it when you run <tt>./configure</tt>. Alternately, you can use
the <tt>--with-sharedir=DIR</tt> option to explicitly specify a
completely different path. (This value can also be changed at runtime,
either via the <tt>TWORLDDIR</tt> environment variable or via the
command line.)
<p>
<h3>
make
</h3>
<p>
This will build the <tt>tworld</tt> binary. There shouldn't be any
serious warnings from the compiler.
<p>
<h3>
make install
</h3>
<p>
Running "make install" as root will do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld</tt> binary to <tt>/usr/local/games</tt>.
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld.6</tt> manpage to <tt>/usr/local/man/man6</tt>.
<li>
Create <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt> if it does not exist. (Or
whatever directory you specified to <tt>./configure</tt>.)
<li>
Copy the external resources (i.e., the bitmaps and wave files) to
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/res</tt>.
<li>
Create the directories <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/data</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/sets</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>sets</tt> directory is where you will store the <tt>.dat</tt>
files that you want to use. However, if you want to make use of a
configuration file with a particular data file, then you will need to
store the data file in the <tt>data</tt> directory, and the
configuration file goes into the <tt>sets</tt> directory instead. (If
you're not sure, then you probably just want to store your data files
in the <tt>sets</tt> directory.)
