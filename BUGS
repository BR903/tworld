I. Bugs in the MS game logic emulation
--------------------------------------

1. The clone machine "boss" may not be set correctly sometimes?

2. "Slide delay" is not emulated. At all. So far my attempts at doing
   so have given rather poor results.

3. Teleporting only works for Chip and blocks.

4. Something causes cloned creatures to freeze up. I don't get it.

5. I'm forgetting at least one other bug.

6. When Chip is on solid ground, and pushes a block that is on ice,
   the block does not move.


II. Bugs in the Lynx game logic emulation
-----------------------------------------

1. The pattern of "clone boosting" is not the same as the Lynx game.
   It's hard to find examples that clearly show this; I have only one.
   Play ICE HOUSE (102) on the Lynx. After landing safely on the red
   button, step right to block off the teeth clones. Stay there. When
   the clock reads 130 seconds or so, there will be a fireball clone
   that is boosted. It will cross the ice just before a glider comes
   through, and the glider will continue on its way past the red
   button. However, in the emuluator, the fireball clone is not
   boosted. As a result, it is still squarely on the ice when the
   glider arrives, and the latter bounces off and retreats. The
   boosting pattern is governed by how slots in the creature list come
   back up for reuse after a creature has been killed. Clearly, the
   emulator is not using the same algorithm as the Lynx game.
   Unfortunately, it's a tedious business to collect any amount of
   data on this that would be necessary to start finding patterns, and
   there are few levels that have the necessary elements for such
   investigation. So this one is still up in the air.

III. Other bugs and misfeatures
-------------------------------

None are known to me at present. I'm sure that will change once other
people start playing with it.

IV. General non-bugs
--------------------

[I expect that some intentional features of the program will strike
other people as perhaps being bugs. This section will be used to list
these non-bugs.]

1. The MS emulation should have an option for doing smooth scrolling.

   The MS ruleset makes it impossible to have sensible smooth
   scrolling. Something like boosting is an obvious example of why
   this can't work. There is no good way to spread Chip's movement out
   in time when the interval before Chip can make another move can
   vary all the way down to zero.
