2001 Aug 27: version 0.5.1

* Made some changes in the game-saving code to avoid infinite loop
  that was sometimes happening under Windows.
* Fixed two bugs in MS game logic identified by Anders Kaesorg. (1.
  Chip can only attempt to move once per tick -- a failed move still
  counts. 2. Creatures moving onto the slide list make their first
  slide move in the same tick.)
* Made keys and boots transparent under MS logic.

2001 Aug 19: version 0.5

* First alpha version.
* The SVGAlib layer has been replaced with a much more complete layer
  for SDL. The program can now be compiled for either X or MS
  Windows. (All hail SDL and gcc's cross-compiling capabilities!) SDL
  also works under SVGAlib, but it looks terrible on my hardware.
* A version of the game logic implementing the MS ruleset (with lots
  of bugs) has been added. The program can now switch between the two
  rulesets.
* I ripped the entire code base apart and put it back together again
  (except for the parts that were thrown out). The code is somewhat
  better organized now.
* Code was added to select data files, display scores, and lots of
  little things all over the place.
* Comments! They're still pretty skeletal, but they're better than
  what was there before.

2001 Jul 15: version 0.1

* The previous game logic has been replaced with a complete game logic
  module for the Lynx ruleset.
* The SVGAlib layer has been heavily rewritten to do raw keyboard
  polling and smooth-scrolling.
* Lots of other changes and bug fixes.

2001 May 19: version 0.0

* First limited public release.
* Most of the basic infrastructure is in place, including a working
  draft of a game logic module.
