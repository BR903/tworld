2001 Oct 22: version 0.7.1

* Fixed bug in MS game logic found by Anders Kaesorg (button not recognized
  when hit by a block being pushed by Chip while on the slip list).

2001 Oct 21: version 0.7.0

* Altered handling of the slip list in the MS game logic. Creatures on the
  slip list now have their slip direction stored separately from their
  pointed direction, and the former is determined at the time they enter a
  tile, instead of just before moving off of it.
* My first serious attempt at implementing slide delay!
* Many little tweaks to the MS logic. I think it's getting close....
* The tile images are no longer compiled into the binary; instead they are
  loaded out of an external bitmap file. The rendering code was changed to
  use 32-bit images internally instead of 8-bit images, so that all types
  of bitmaps can be accepted.
* Added a new shared subdirectory for holding the data files; the main
  shared directory is now used to hold images.
* Altered the onomatopoeia code to ease future introduction of sound.
* Fixed the Lynx bug regarding the bequeathing of a slide token, or rather
  the lack thereof, when Chip is at a force-floor dead end.

2001 Oct 05: version 0.6.0

* Rewrote several fundamentals of the MS game logic, in order to bring it
  more in line with MS's layered map, as well as its treatment of blocks as
  non-creatures.
* Made some general changes to the game internals in order to accommodate
  the above changes.
* Many tweaks and improvements to the MS game logic.
* Added the Ctrl-X feature to permit replacement of saved games --
  something I should have added a long time ago.

2001 Aug 27: version 0.5.1

* Made some changes in the game-saving code to avoid an infinite loop that
  was sometimes happening under Windows.
* Fixed two bugs in MS game logic identified by Anders Kaesorg. (1. Chip
  can only attempt to move once per tick -- a failed move still counts. 2.
  Creatures moving onto the slide list make their first slide move in the
  same tick.)

2001 Aug 19: version 0.5

* First alpha version.
* The SVGAlib layer has been replaced with a much more complete layer for
  SDL. The program can now be compiled for either X or MS Windows. (All
  hail SDL and gcc's cross-compiling capabilities!) SDL also works under
  SVGAlib, but it looks terrible on my hardware.
* A version of the game logic implementing the MS ruleset (with lots of
  bugs) has been added. The program can now switch between the two
  rulesets.
* I ripped the entire code base apart and put it back together again
  (except for the parts that were thrown out). The code is somewhat better
  organized now.
* Code was added to select data files, display scores, and lots of little
  things all over the place.
* Comments! They're still pretty skeletal, but they're better than what was
  there before.

2001 Jul 15: version 0.1

* The previous game logic has been replaced with a complete game logic
  module for the Lynx ruleset.
* The SVGAlib layer has been heavily rewritten to do raw keyboard polling
  and smooth-scrolling.
* Lots of other changes and bug fixes.

2001 May 19: version 0.0

* First limited public release.
* Most of the basic infrastructure is in place, including a working draft
  of a game logic module.
