Welcome to Tile World
</h1></center>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the
Atari Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS
Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).
<p>
This is a pre-release version of Tile World, meaning that I currently
believe the program to be complete. Documentation and some final
testing are the main tasks that need to be completed before making a
1.0 release.
<p>
For directions on getting the program set up and running, see the
INSTALL file.
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game engines only. It does not come
with the <tt>chips.dat</tt> level file, which is copyrighted and
cannot be freely distributed. If you do not own a copy of the MS game,
however, you can still play Tile World with the many freely available
level files created by fans of the original game.

<h2>Some Notes on the External Resource Files</h2>
<p>
Tile World loads most of its resource data at runtime from external
files. (The one exception is the program icon, which is hard-coded.)
These files are stored in the <tt>res</tt> directory. You can specify
a different directory at runtime using the -R command-line option.
<p>
The <tt>rc</tt> file in this directory lists the actual file names for
each resource. Different files can be used for any or all resources
depending on whether the Lynx or the MS ruleset is in effect. The
first section of the <tt>rc</tt> file specifies resources used with
either. Then follows two sections, prefixed with a line containing
either <tt>[MS]</tt> or <tt>[Lynx]</tt>, containing files specific to
the given ruleset.
<p>
The <tt>TileImages</tt> resource names the bitmap file containing the
complete set of tiles. The tiles in this bitmap are organized in the
same fashion as the bitmap resource embedded in the Windows executable
<tt>chips.exe</tt>. If you have this program and a resource editor,
you can obtain this bitmap and use it as the <tt>TileImages</tt>
resource to make the game appear more like the MS version. (Note that
this bitmap contains three unused tiles. These positions are used by
Tile World to provide tiles that only appear in the Lynx ruleset. So,
if you wish to use this bitmap for playing under both rulesets, it is
strongly advised that you supply non-blank images for these.)
<p>
Most of the resources are sound files. The Tile World resource names
for the sounds in the MS ruleset have been chosen to match the keys
that are used in the <tt>entpack.ini</tt> file. This permits you to
take the sound files that are included with the MS version of the
game, copy them to Tile World's resource directory, and then
cut-and-paste the lines identifying the sound files from MS's
<tt>entpack.ini</tt> to Tile World's <tt>rc</tt> file, if you so
choose.
