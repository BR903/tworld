Welcome to Tile World
</h1></center>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the
Atari Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS
Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).
<p>
<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the "Chip's Challenge" game engines
only. It does <em>not</em> come with the <tt>chips.dat</tt> file that
contains the original level set. That file, which is copyrighted and
cannot be freely distributed, was originally distributed with the MS
version of "Chip's Challenge". If you have a copy of this version of
the game, you can use that file to play the original games in Tile
World. If you do not have a copy of this file, however, you can still
play Tile World with the many freely available level files created by
fans of the original game.
<p>
<h2>Installing Tile World under Windows</h2>
<p>
There's no automatic installer (yet), so you will need to do this
manually.
<p>
First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive
into its own separate directory. So, if you haven't already done so,
create a new directory -- something like
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp></tt> -- and extract the files there.
<p>
If you have a copy of the <tt>chips.dat</tt> data file, copy it to the
<tt>data</tt> subdirectory. This will allow you to play the original
levels under Tile World (for the MS ruleset and the Lynx ruleset
both).
<p>
If you have other data files that you would like to try out in Tile
World, copy those to the <tt>sets</tt> directory.
<p>
The MSDOS commands to do the above would look something like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy chips.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\data</tt>
<br>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\my\collection\of\dat\files</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy *.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\sets</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp>\tworld</tt>, or create a shortcut for it.
<p>
<h2>Installing Tile World under Linux</h2>
<p>
Before proceeding, ensure that you have SDL installed on your
machine. (If you don't have SDL, you can get it by visiting
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download.html">http://www.libsdl.org/download.html</a>.
If you download a precompiled version -- i.e., an .rpm or .deb file --
note that you will need the development runtime, as opposed to the
binary runtime.)
<p>
Installing Tile World involves the usual three-part incantation:
<p>
<h4>./configure</h4>
<p>
By default, the program is set up so that it will keep its shared
files under <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>. If you would prefer the
<tt>tworld</tt> directory to be somewhere besides
<tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, use the <tt>--datadir</tt> option to change
it when you run <tt>./configure</tt>. Alternately, you can use the
<tt>--with-sharedir=DIR</tt> option to explicitly specify a completely
different path. (This value can also be changed at runtime, either via
the <tt>TWORLDDIR</tt> environment variable or via the command line.)
<p>
<h4>make</h4>
<p>
There shouldn't be any serious warnings from the compiler. Use "make
mklynxcc" if you want to also build a copy of <tt>mklynxcc</tt> (see
below).
<p>
<h4>make install</h4>
<p>
Running "make install" as root will do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld</tt> binary to <tt>/usr/local/games</tt>.
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld.6</tt> manpage to <tt>/usr/local/man/man6</tt>.
<li>
Create <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt> if it does not exist. (Or
whatever directory you specified to <tt>./configure</tt>.)
<li>
Copy the external resources (i.e., the bitmaps and wave files) to
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/res</tt>.
<li>
Create the directories <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/data</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/sets</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>sets</tt> directory is where you will store the <tt>.dat</tt>
files that you want to use. However, if you want to make use of a
configuration file with a particular data file, then you will need to
store the data file in the <tt>data</tt> directory, and the
configuration file goes into the <tt>sets</tt> directory instead. See
the documentation for more information.
<p>
<h2>The Complete Documentation</h2>
<p>
The full documentation for Tile World is included with the
distribution, in the file <tt>tworld.html</tt>. There you will find 
information on how to play the game, adding new level sets,
customizing Tile World, and more.
<p>
<h2>Creating new level sets for the Lynx ruleset</h2>
<p>
At the time of this writing, there do not exist any user-created level
sets for the Lynx ruleset. The reason for this is very simple; there
has not been any way to play such levels before. Hopefully, now that
Tile World exists, that will change in the near future.
<p>
If you yourself would like to create new level sets, then get a copy
of ChipEdit, if you haven't already. ChipEdit can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.stage62.com/chipedit/chipedit.htm">http://www.stage62.com/chipedit/chipedit.htm</a>.
This Windows program will permit you to create new level sets of your
own design. Naturally, ChipEdit will default to creating levels for
the MS ruleset. To make levels for the Lynx ruleset, you have a few
options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
ChipEdit has a special feature which allows you to control the
signature of the data file. This is done by adding a
<tt>SIGNATURE</tt> entry to the <tt>chipedit.ini</tt> file. The
default signature value is <tt>0x0002AAAC</tt>, which indicates a data
file that uses the MS ruleset. If you set the <tt>SIGNATURE</tt> to be
<tt>0x0102AAAC</tt>, then ChipEdit will create data files marked to
use the Lynx ruleset instead.
<li>
A very simple command-line utility is included with Tile World, called
<tt>mklynxcc</tt>. This program will change a normal <tt>.dat</tt>
file to one that will use the Lynx ruleset instead of the MS ruleset.
Running <tt>mklynxcc <samp>foo.dat</samp></tt> will change
<tt><samp>foo.dat</samp></tt>'s ruleset from MS to Lynx.
<li>
Finally, you can use a configuration file to override the builtin
ruleset. This method requires creating an extra file, but does allows
you to avoid making changes to the <tt>.dat</tt> file. See the
complete documentation for information on how to set up a
configuration file.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Resources on the Internet</h2>
<p>
There is quite a bit of information about "Chip's Challenge" available
on the internet. Much of it is focused on maximizing your score on the
"original" level set for the MS game, but you will also find lots of
general help and useful information as well.
<p>
Richard Field and Jimmy Vermeer both maintain a page of links to
nearly everything on the net related to "Chip's Challenge". Between
the two of them you can probably find what you're looking for, if it's
out there:

"Chip's Challenge" was designed by Chuck Sommerville, who is also the
author of the original Lynx program.

<p>
Creating this program would have been flatly impossible without the
help of several fans of "Chip's Challenge". The author would
particularly like to acknowledge Anders Kaseorg for sharing the fruits
of his investigations into the game logic of the MS version and for
being an effective bug hunter, and Chuck Sommerville for his pointers
regarding the game logic of the Lynx version and his unfailing support
of this project.
<p>
Many other regulars of the annexcafe.chips.challenge newsgroup
assisted with bug reports, suggestions, and all-around encouragement.
Their help is gratefully acknowledged.
<p>
The anonymous author of the document describing the <tt>.dat</tt> file
format, Don Gregory, the "Charter Chipsters", and the contributors to
the CC AVI library all deserve mention as well -- this program would
never have been written without the information they made freely
available.
<p>
Last but not least, a tip of the hat to John K. Elion for writing
ChipEdit.
