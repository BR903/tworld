Welcome to Tile World
</h1></center>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the
Atari Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS
Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).
<p>
<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the "Chip's Challenge" game engines
only. It does <em>not</em> come with the <tt>chips.dat</tt> file that
contains the original level set. This file is copyrighted and cannot
be freely distributed.
<p>
The <tt>chips.dat</tt> file was originally distributed with the MS
version of "Chip's Challenge". If you have a copy of this version of
the game, you can use that file to play the original games in Tile
World.
<p>
If you do not have a copy of this file, however, you can still play
Tile World with the many freely available level files created by fans
of the original game.
<p>
<h2>Installing Tile World under Windows</h2>
<p>
There's no automatic installer (yet), so you will need to do this
manually.
<p>
First of all, you'll want to store the files contained in this archive
into its own separate directory. So, if you haven't already done so,
create a new directory -- something like
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp></tt> -- and extract the files there.
<p>
If you have a copy of the <tt>chips.dat</tt> data file, copy it to the
<tt>data</tt> subdirectory. For example:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\wherever\my\copy\of\chips\challenge\is\at</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy chips.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\data</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have other data files that you would like to try out in the
clone, copy those to the <tt>sets</tt> directory instead:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>cd <samp>c:\my\collection\of\dat\files</samp></tt>
<br>
<tt>copy *.dat <samp>c:\tworld</samp>\sets</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
(If you're curious as to why the other <tt>.dat</tt> files go in a
different directory, see the documentation on configuration files.)
<p>
That's all that needs to be done to set it up. Run the program as
<tt><samp>c:\tworld</samp>\tworld</tt>, or create a shortcut for it.
<p>
<h2>Installing Tile World under Linux</h2>
<p>
Before proceeding, ensure that you have SDL installed on your
machine. (If you don't have SDL, you can get it by visiting
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download.html">http://www.libsdl.org/download.html</a>.
If you download a precompiled version -- i.e., an .rpm or .deb file --
note that you will need the development runtime, as opposed to the
binary runtime.)
<p>
Installing Tile World involves the usual three-part incantation:
<p>
<h4>./configure</h4>
<p>
By default, the program is set up so that it will keep its shared
files under <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt>. If you would prefer the
<tt>tworld</tt> directory to be somewhere besides
<tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, use the <tt>--datadir</tt> option to change
it when you run <tt>./configure</tt>. Alternately, you can use the
<tt>--with-sharedir=DIR</tt> option to explicitly specify a completely
different path. (This value can also be changed at runtime, either via
the <tt>TWORLDDIR</tt> environment variable or via the command line.)
<p>
<h4>make</h4>
<p>
There shouldn't be any serious warnings from the compiler. Use "make
mklynxcc" if you want to also build a copy of <tt>mklynxcc</tt> (see
below).
<p>
<h4>make install</h4>
<p>
Running "make install" as root will do the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld</tt> binary to <tt>/usr/local/games</tt>.
<li>
Copy the <tt>tworld.6</tt> manpage to <tt>/usr/local/man/man6</tt>.
<li>
Create <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld</tt> if it does not exist. (Or
whatever directory you specified to <tt>./configure</tt>.)
<li>
Copy the external resources (i.e., the bitmaps and wave files) to
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/res</tt>.
<li>
Create the directories <tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/data</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/share/tworld/sets</tt>.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>sets</tt> directory is where you will store the <tt>.dat</tt>
files that you want to use. However, if you want to make use of a
configuration file with a particular data file, then you will need to
store the data file in the <tt>data</tt> directory, and the
configuration file goes into the <tt>sets</tt> directory instead.
(See the complete documentation for information on configuration
files.)
<p>
<h2>Resources on the Internet</h2>
<p>
There is quite a bit of information about "Chip's Challenge" available
on the internet. Much of it is focused on maximizing your score on the
"original" level set for the MS game, but you will also find lots of
general help and useful information as well.
<p>
Richard Field's web page has links to almost everything else:

<p>
There is a Yahoo group for "Chip's Challenge", from which you can
download user-created level sets:

"Chip's Challenge" was originally invented by Chuck Sommerville, who
is also the author of the original Lynx version.

Creating this program would have been flatly impossible without the
help of several fans of "Chip's Challenge". The author would
particularly like to acknowledge Anders Kaesorg for sharing the fruits
of his investigations into the MS version of the game and for being an
effective bug hunter; and Chuck Sommerville for his unfailing support
of this project.
<p>
Many of the regular reads of the annexcafe.chips.challenge newsgroup
also offered their assistance via bug reports, suggestions, and
all-around encouragement.
<p>
The anonymous author of the document describing the <tt>.dat</tt> file
format, Don Gregory, the "Charter Chipsters", and the many
contributors to the CC AVI library all deserve mention. This program
would never have been written without the information all these people
made freely available. Finally, a tip of the hat to John K. Elion for
writing ChipEdit.
