Welcome to Tile World
</h1></center>
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge" for the
Atari Lynx, created by Chuck Sommerville, and later ported to MS
Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).
<p>
This is an alpha release of Tile World. The program works quite well
as it now stands, but is missing a couple of features that are needed
before a beta release.
<p>
See the INSTALL file for directions on getting the program set up and
running.
<p>
Tile World is an emulation of the game engines only. It does not come
with the <tt>chips.dat</tt> level file, which is copyrighted and
cannot be freely distributed. If you do not own a copy of
<tt>chips.dat</tt>, however, you can still play Tile World with the
many freely available level files created by fans of the original
game.
<p>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>
At this time I am unaware of any bugs in the support code (e.g., the
code that finds and lists the available data files, calculates scores,
and so on). The bugs in the game logic that are known to me are
relatively minor. See the <a href="BUGS.html">BUGS</a> file for
details.
<p>
Bug reports are always appreciated, and should be sent to me at
&lt;breadbox@muppetlabs.com&gt;.
